## Advanced exercises
If you want to explore Docker plugins even further, here are some additional exercises:

- Try to modify our volume plugin to mount remote networked storage like NFS, GluserFS, etc. on the host and make it available as a volume to the container

- Try to run containers with --net=none and see if you can use one of the network plugins to allow communication between local containers. Can you make it work with a multi-host setup as well?
